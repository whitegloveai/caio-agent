## Project Name: LOTUS

### AI Solution Designing for Calpine

Wesley, an Analyst, at Calpine company located in Houston, is managing a critical project named LOTUS. The primary objectives of the LOTUS project are to streamline the management of spreadsheets and reports across 7 silo'd data systems with an aim to leverage AI, particularly focusing on LLM (Large Language Model) solutions.

### Business Challenges
- The major issue faced by Calpine is the decentralized management of spreadsheets by business users. This doesn't streamline processes and results in a lack of coherent reporting procedures.
- There needs to be a systematic process to manage these reports by using advanced AI modeling and analytic techniques.

### Major Data Sources:
- S3
- Maxima

### Solution Design
This solution involves:
1. Centralized Repository: Migration of all spreadsheets and reports to a centralized storage system. This can be achieved by using cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3.
2. Data Integration Pipeline: Creating an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to consolidate data from silo'd systems including Maxima.
3. AI & ML Models: Developing LLM capabilities which understand, categorize, and generate insights from documents intelligently.
4. BI Dashboard: Implementing Business Intelligence tools to visualize data insights clearly.

### Technical Stack Consideration:
- AWS S3 for centralized data storage.
- Apache NiFi for data integration.
- Python (with Pandas, NumPy) for processing datasets.
- Business Intelligence: Apache Superset or Tableau.
- LLM Solution: GPT architecture custom-trained for document management tasks.

### Deployment Considerations:
- **Public Cloud Scenario:** Hosting ML solutions and datasets on AWS. Leveraging AWS EC2 for compute services.
- **Private Cloud Scenario:** For sensitive data, setting up a private cloud using OpenStack or VMware on-premise to ensure data security and compliance.

### Implementation Timeline & Efforts
- Scoping & Planning: 1 month
- Execution (Centralized Repository & Integration): 3 months
- Execution (AI Modeling & BI Tools): 4 months
- Testing & Quality Assurance: 1 month
- Rollout & Training: 1 month

### Scope of Work
- Assessment of existing spreadsheet and reporting infrastructure.
- Training of LLM on existing datasets for document management.
- Testing deployment scenarios to gauge accessibility and security.
- User training for new system adaptability.

Overall, the LOTUS project is aimed at transforming the way data and reports are handled within Calpine using advanced AI and machine learning solutions, ensuring efficiency and improved data insights.
